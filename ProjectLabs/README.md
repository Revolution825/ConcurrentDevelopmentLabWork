# ProjectLabs
This lab shows a sequential and concurrent implementation of The Game of Life. Basic implementation elements include a main function as the main entry point, a frame function to handle updating and drawing to the screen, the update function handles all the logic and rules and the display function draws everything to the screen.
For concurrent implementation, create a number of workers and send jobs to available workers using a channel. In this concurrent implementation each worker handles a column of the grid.
